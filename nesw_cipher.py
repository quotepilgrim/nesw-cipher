"""NorthEast SouthWest Cipher

This is a tool to encipher plaintext messages with a hand cipher created by the
author of this tool. The cipher has similarities with the Vigen√®re and Playfair
ciphers.

The cipher consists of finding each letter of the plaintext in a 5x5 square
containing the alphabet and writing in the ciphertext the letter that is
adjacent to it in one of the eight cardinal and ordinal directions, starting
from the chosen direction (north by default) and rotating around the compass
rose once after each letter by a chosen rotation, wrapping around the edges of
the square as necessary. The default is to rotate by 2 steps after each letter,
skipping the ordinal directions if a cardinal direction was chosen and
vice-versa. While using all 8 directions results in a stronger cipher, 2 steps
was chosen as the default because the cipher originally only used the cardinal
directions.

A keyword may also be used to reorder the letters of the alphabet for building
the square, as is usually done in the Playfair cipher. Since the modern version
of the Latin alphabet contains 26 letters, one letter is omitted from the
square and replaced in the plaintext and keyword with a different letter,
preferably one that looks like the omitted letter. For instance, if "J" is
omitted it may be replaced with "I" (this is the default), or "V" may be
replaced with "U".

Deciphering a message is done by the same process as enciphering, with all
choices being the same, except the starting direction, which must be opposite
to the one used for enciphering.
